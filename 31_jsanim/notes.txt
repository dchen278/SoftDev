K31 -- animation in canvas JS
2023-04-26w

DISCO
- We set requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame(drawDot) after we cancel animation frames
- All you need to pause the animation is window.requestAnimationFrame(drawDot)
- StrokeStyle is what allows you to have the border on the edge of your circle
  for Nakib's last homework the strokeStyle and the fillStyle were both red so the border was not visible

QCC
- How do we get to the turqoise color on the board?
