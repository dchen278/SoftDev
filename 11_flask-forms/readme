Prediction:
  - <form action="/auth"> causes the server to run the function decorated with @app.route("/auth").
  - input type="submit" creates a submit button
  - input type="text" creates a text field
  - print(request.args) displays user input in the terminal

Observations:
  - request.args prints info entered by user on the page
  - submitting info performs a GET request, changing the URL to display info
  - leading and trailing whitespace is ignored in <form action="/auth ">, but not in @app.route("/auth ")
  - removing "GET" from the methods field in app.route() causes that route to not be accessible in browser

Questions:
  - What the '?' do in the URL for /auth?
  - What is a POST request and what it do?
