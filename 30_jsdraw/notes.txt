Disco
1. After passing in e as a function parameter, it can be treated like an object. We can access it's attributes by using the . operand
2. A circle can be drawn by using an arc that begins at angle 0 and ends at angle 2pi (which is the circumference of the circle)
3. To get a circle to appear, you need to use the exact value of Pi with Math.PI or else the circle will not appear

QCC
1. Are there any built in mechanisms to draw a circle?
2. Why didn't the function calls toggleMode and wipeCanvas work when we called toggleMode() and wipeCanvas()
